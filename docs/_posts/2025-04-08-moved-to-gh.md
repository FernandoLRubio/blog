So, yeah. I got tired of paying ghost.org for a blog I tend to forget about.
I've been paying 12 USD per month for ghost pro since 2023.

I'm now slowly moving the blog to Github pages, which is **FREE**. Lovely.

I might not bring back every old post, I still need to figure out how to share
image galleries, probably through a third-party gallery service. Let me know if 
you know a good self-hosted one.

Also, I've not enabled comments, I'm trying to keep the blog as minimal as 
possible.

That's it. bye.
